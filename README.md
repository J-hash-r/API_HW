# API_HW

Challenging HW, Late submission as I had a struggle getting through an API call to extract and build a DF. GOt there eventually!   

api_keys not uploaded, Marker will need to supply their own.

Strong corellation, 0.84 pearson r value for temperature an latitiude northern hemisphere.

Weak corellation between temperature and latitude for southern hemisphere, 0.42. THis could be due to a lack of data points compared to northern hemisphere locations. FOr further research would aim for an even list for both northern and southern hemispheres

Similar coreallation between latittude and humidity for both northern and southern locations, corellation of 0.33 and 0.36 respectively, Not a massive link but some signs of one.

Very little corellation between cloudiness and latitude, only 0.18 and 0.06 respectivley for northern and southern. 

Very little corellation between windspeed and latitude in the northern hemisphere, I think this is because more landcoverage compared to southenr hemisphere. Southern Hemsphere, weak corellation of -0.45 R value, Higher wind speeds experienced at more southern latitiudes.
